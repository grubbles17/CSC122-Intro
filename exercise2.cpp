//Write a program that reads in an integer and breaks it into a sequence of individual digits. 
// For example, the input 16384 is displayed as

//1  6  3  8  4

//Make sure the input has no more than five characters and is not negative. 
//(You donâ€™t have to do this through code) Just make sure you enter correct data when running the program.

//Sample Output: 
//Enter an integer: 16384
//The digits extracted from integer 16384 are:
//1  6  3  8  4
