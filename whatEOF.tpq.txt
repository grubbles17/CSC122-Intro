------Question 1 ------------What do you mean EOF?!--------
I suppose it would be pretty bad to be unsure if you got to
the end of the file or not before closing it.
--------------------Question 2 ------------ 
The eof calls should be placed in a open file, a loop
and within a if/else statement. Prior to being closed.
--------------------Question 3 ------------ 
Yes, if not taking care with eof checks you can create problems 
with the compiler which will stop the program and leave a
strange message.
